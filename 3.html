<p>The ECMAScript specification is a standardized specification of
   a scripting language developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape;
    initially it was named Mocha, later LiveScript, and finally
     JavaScript.[3] In December 1995, Sun Microsystems and Netscape announced JavaScript in a press release.[4] In November 1996, Netscape announced a meeting of the Ecma International standards organization to advance the standardization of JavaScript.[5] The first edition of ECMA-262 was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly in June 1997. Several editions of the language standard have been published since then. The name "ECMAScript" was a compromise between the organizations involved in standardizing the language, especially Netscape and Microsoft,
      whose disputes dominated the early standards sessions. Eich
       commented that "ECMAScript was always an unwanted trade name
        that sounds like a skin disease."While both JavaScript and
         JScript aim to be compatible with ECMAScript, they also
         provide additional features not described in the ECMA
         specifications.</p>
